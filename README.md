# Overview

This in-class assignment is going to teach you the basics of testing in Clojure. Open the file 
test/clj/engn_web/local_messaging_test.clj file for directions.

# Running the Tests

Use the command "lein test-refresh" to run the tests in a terminal. This command will keep running 
and execute the tests every time that you make a change and save a file. Look at the terminal for
test results.
